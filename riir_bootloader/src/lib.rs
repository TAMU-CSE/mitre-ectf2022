//! # The SAFFRIIR System
//!
//! > _SAFFIRe but it's rewritten in Rustâ„¢_
//!
//! This is TAMU's submission for MITRE's 2022 Embedded System CTF (eCTF)!
//!
//! ## Building
//!
//! We **strongly** recommend you build with the provided [Docker image](../../dockerfiles/1_build_saffire.Dockerfile), following the [instructions](https://github.tamu.edu/mitre-ectf-2022/2022-ectf-insecure-example/blob/master/getting_started.md) provided by MITRE's [reference implementation](https://github.tamu.edu/mitre-ectf-2022/2022-ectf-insecure-example).
//!
//! ## Project Layout
//! The SAFFRIIR system is split into 3 main crates:
//! - [`riir_host_tools`]: Rust implementation of the host-tools.
//! - [`riir_bootloader`]: Rust implementation of the bootloader (you're already here).
//!   The entry point is in the [`bootloader`] crate.
//! - [`gen_eeprom`]: Rust tooling to generate an EEPROM image with pre-initialized secrets.
//!
//! ## Design
//! While the core functionality remains the same as the reference implementation, there are
//! two key differences:
//!
//! - It's written in Rust!
//! - It's (hopefully) secure!
//!
//! We chose to implement our design in Rust due to its core tenants of memory safety, performance,
//! and developer ergonomics. To remove dependencies on C code, we ported over the necessary
//! functionality from the provided TivaWare library, using the TM4C123GH6PM data sheet as a
//! reference.
//!
//! To harden the SAFFRIIR system's security, we implement the following tactics: 
//! ### Confidentiality
//! - Packages are transmitted and stored encrypted via [`crypto_secretstream`].
//! - Secrets in EEPROM are stored encrypted via [`chacha20poly1305`].
//! - We chose ChaCha20Poly1305 over other encryption schemes due to its built-in integrity
//!   checking via [AEAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption) and less prolific
//!   literature on power analysis attacks (compared to [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)).
//! ### Integrity
//! - To mitigate the flash trojan, the bootloader primarily runs in SRAM. A further discussion
//!   can be found in the documentation of the [`bootloader`] crate.
//! - Any flash writes are immediately followed by verification checks to ensure the `.text`
//!   section is not maliciously modified.
//! - Random jitter in execution delay is applied before critical checks to mitigate fault injection.
//! ### Authenticity
//! - Every host-tool that issues a bootloader command must authenticate itself before the
//!   bootloader proceeds with command execution. Signature production and verification is provided
//!   by the [`p256`] crate.
//! - All received packages contain signed hashes, which are verified against hardcoded public keys in
//!   EEPROM.

//! [`bootloader`]: ../bootloader/index.html
